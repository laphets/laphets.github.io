## Bug 1442249
### What I do
Find inner logic from nested components, fulfill a right-click context menu
### How do I solve the problem
Generally, learn by imitate. Just learn how to fulfill context menu from existing example, and check how existing code do copy to clipboard :)
Besides, the key point here is to find the data that should be copied. At first, I try to use dfs(deep first search) to find the data by path, however, it's a high risk job, and may fail in some ways. With an glance of the code of `treeview`, I accidently find that it's a good idea to utilze the existing member object, which contains all the data needed. In the end, all the problem solved.
### What I learnt
It's very to utlize the exisiting code for a huge codebase project, since many things which you want to do is not "new"

## Bug 1457379
### What I do
First find reason why websocket not shown in the request list, then using existing data to give a robust solution for websocket checking.
### How do I implement the tests
In fact, as what I have said to Honza before, using default http server(`sjs`) to process websocket request doesnâ€™t seem very good. A continuous solution is to utlize the websocket server while it relates to some Python script.
But temporarily http server is used for test.
