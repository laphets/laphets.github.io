### Overview
This project is designed for the new HR System, it is generated by CodeIgniter, written in PHP.
(And it's also our homework)
### Server Requirements
PHP version 7.1.6 or newer is recommended.
### How to deploy on your own sever
There are two files contained in config directory, which you must modify just to satisfy your own environment(**config.php** and **database.php**)

And the following statements are what you should pay attention to

config.php

```php
$config['base_url'] = '';
$config['sess_expiration'] = 0;
$config['cookie_domain'] = '';
```

database.php

```php
'hostname' => '',
'username' => '',
'password' => '',
'database' => '',
```
