Typically, iterators are used to access elements of a container in linear fashion; however, with "random access iterators", it is possible to access any element in the same fashion as `operator[]`.

To **access arbitrary elements in a vector** `vec`, you can use the following:

```
vec.begin() // 1st vec.begin()+1 // 2nd // ... vec.begin()+(i-1) // ith // ... vec.begin()+(vec.size()-1) // last
```

The following is an example of a **typical access pattern** (earlier versions of C++):

```
int sum = 0; using Iter = std::vector\<int\>::const\_iterator; for (Iter it = vec.begin(); it!=vec.end(); ++it) { sum += \*it; }
```

The advantage of using iterator is that you can apply the **same pattern with other containers**:

```
sum = 0; for (Iter it = lst.begin(); it!=lst.end(); ++it) { sum += \*it; }
```

For this reason, it is really easy to create template code that will work the same **regardless of the container type**. Another advantage of iterators is that it doesn't assume the data is resident in memory; for example, one could create a forward iterator that can read data from an input stream, or that simply generates data on the fly (e.g. a range or random number generator).

Another option using `std::for_each` and lambdas:

```
sum = 0; std::for\_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [&sum](int i) { sum += i; });
```

Since C++11 you can use `auto` to avoid specifying a very long, complicated type name of the iterator as seen before (or even more complex):

```
sum = 0; for (auto it = vec.begin(); it!=vec.end(); ++it) { sum += \*it; }
```

And, in addition, there is a simpler for-each variant:

```
sum = 0; for (auto value : vec) { sum += value; }
```

And finally there is also `std::accumulate` where you have to be careful whether you are adding integer or floating point numbers.
